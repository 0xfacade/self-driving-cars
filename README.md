# Learning machine learning with self-driving cars

Here, I want to simulate a flat 2D world filled with obstacles
that is safely navigated by cars steered by the computer.

I am a beginner to machine learning and want to learn by building
something awesome. I will document everything I learn in files
in the doc directory.
